## Tips & Best Practices

### For Color Variants:
1. **Use high-quality images** - Each color should have its own clear product image
2. **Consistent naming** - Use standard color names (Black, White, Blue, not "Dark Night")
3. **Set realistic stock** - Update stock levels regularly
4. **Price differences** - If all colors are same price, use the base product price

### For Bulk Pricing:
1. **Calculate savings carefully** - Make sure the bundle price shows real savings
2. **Use tags strategically** - Only tag 1-2 options as MOST_POPULAR or BEST_VALUE
3. **Progressive discounts** - Bundle of 3 should have better per-unit price than Bundle of 2
4. **Stock management** - Consider bundle stock vs individual item stock

### Mobile Optimization:
- All variant displays are fully responsive
- Touch-friendly buttons and selections
- Horizontal scrolling for many color options
- Clear visual feedback for selections
